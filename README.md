## About this project

Open3D is an open-source library that supports rapid development of software that deals with 3D data. The Open3D frontend exposes a set of carefully selected data structures and algorithms in both C++ and Python. The backend is highly optimized and is set up for parallelization. We welcome contributions from the open-source community.

Although the Open3D project is currently maintained by `Hamdi Sahloul`, it was initiated by `Qianyi Zhou` and `Jaesik Park`, who have wrote [a paper](http://www.open3d.org/paper.pdf), and they ask you to kindly cite it! Their project is [achieved here](https://github.com/Sahloul/Open3D-legacy).
